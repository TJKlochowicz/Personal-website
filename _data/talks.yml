    **Abstract:** This paper's main focus lies on the compositional semantics of clause-embedding predicates, i.e. verbs or verb-like expressions that represent a relationship between a subject
    and a proposition. It provides an improved characterisation of the selectional behaviour
    of the classes of responsive and anti-rogative predicates in terms of their semantic properties. I propose refinements of the hypotheses by Uegaki and Sudo (2019) and Roelofsen
    and Uegaki(2021), that are falsified by empirical data. My new proposals are that
    all     non-veridical and positively preferential predicates are anti-rogative
    and that all responsive predicates are either Q-to-P or P-to-Q distributive. The latter hypothesis can be
    alternatively formulated as: “sentences with corresponding interrogative and declarative
    complements embedded under the same predicate are always related by entailment.

     **Abstract**: Polar questions like 'May I go to the park or to the beach?' give rise to inferences similar to Free Choice Permission. The *Yes* answer to these questions corresponds to the permission to freely choose between going to the park and going to the beach. *No* corresponds to Dual Prohibition, i.e., prohibition to go to either place. I empirically tested these intuitions. I will indicate how the collected data can allow us to establish the source of these inferences and compare the findings to predictions made by current theories of Free Choice extended with question semantics. The collected data poses a challenge to the semantic and scalar approaches to *free choice* and supports non-scalar pragmatics as a uniform solution to the *free choice* puzzle.

      The similarity approach to conditionals (Stalnaker 1968, Lewis 1973) predicts Reciprocity to be valid: whenever 𝐴 > 𝐵, 𝐵 > 𝐴 and 𝐴 > 𝐶 are true, 𝐵 > 𝐶 is true (where 𝐴 > 𝐵 denotes if 𝐴 would 𝐵). We ran an experiment to test the validity of this rule. Strikingly,
      half of our participants judged the rule invalid, i.e. judged in at least one scenario that it does not preserve truth. Our data also challenge Kratzer’s (2012) and Fine’s (2012) semantics of
      conditionals, but we show that McHugh’s (2022) aboutness approach can account for our data.

  description: >
    To address the issue of BSML with Wide Scope Obligation, we propose that this splitting not only affects the state of evluation, but
    also the accessibility relation. Splitting represents a tendency to entertain different alternatives (possibilities) separately. 
    These alternatives can be ‘actual’, when the state is split, but they can also be modal, when the relation is split. 
    The resulting logics preserves all the important Free Choice inferences from BSML, without falling into the problem of Wide Scope Obligation.
    We will also propose an alternative solution, which treats states of evaluation as sets of paths, and not sets of worlds.

      The MECORE project by Uegaki et al. (2022) provides a cross-linguistic database of clause-
      embedding predicates, which provides empirical confirmation or falsification to the hypotheses
      postulated in the literature. I present a Python package which allows for the analysis of the
      collected data, verification of the existing hypotheses about the selectional behaviour of those
      predicates, and discovery of novel hypotheses using Machine Learning.

  description: >
      Several inferences in natural language deviate from classical logic, among them upper-
      bound inferences normally analysed as scalar implicatures, distributive infer-
      ences of disjunction but also certain empty-set effects in the interpretation of (mostly)
      downward-entailing quantifiers such as *less than*. We present a direct empirical comparison sug-
      gesting that diverse tools are needed to capture the processing of these inferences.

     Assertions with scalar terms such as *some* and *or* famously yield pragmatic inferences negating their stronger alternatives *all* and *and*, respectively. 
     According to Chierchia et al. (2004), these inferences disappear in environments licensing weak NPIs like *any*. 
     However, examples provided by Magri (2011) and Hurford disjunctions of scalar terms in question still behave as if the implicatures were computed. 
     Moreover, questions with scalar terms are sensitive to context and prior beliefs of the speaker. 
     I propose to generalise the exhaustification operator to work on questions and derive implicatures in questions as a negative biased to the questions in the alternative set.

      Recent studies use semantic structural priming to show that various cases of linguistic strengthening happen through a common mechanism: generation of implicatures through alternative-based (scalar) reasoning. In this paper, we used priming to investigate another group of cases, where strengthening is postulated to follow from the tendency to systematically neglect structures that verify a sentence by virtue of an empty configuration (neglect-zero): empty-set quantifiers ('at most/fewer than') and disjunction under a universal quantifier. We report data indicating semantic priming between these two structures, but not between them and scalar 'some'. We propose that 1. there is a common mechanism in use for strengthening constructions postulated to follow from the neglect-zero tendency, and that 2. this mechanism is different from the one involved in alternative-based reasoning.

      Adults usually interpret disjunction exclusively. Preschool children instead sometimes interpret disjunctions as conjunctions. Conjunctive readings persist under other operators, such as modalities and quantifiers. We propose to explain this behaviour by two independently motivated cognitive biases: 1. Neglect-zero (Aloni 2022) 2. No-split (Sbardolini 2025). We argue that children have more issues suspending the biases than adults. We claim that the conjunctive readings are independent of the ability to engage with alternative-based structures and hence do not constitute evidence against Chierchia’s claim that the ability to exhaustify is acquired late. Our theory predicts conjunctive interpretations to be simpler and to occur earlier than inclusive ones. This prediction is orthogonal to the exhaustifcation-based theories, which are committed to the claims that children compute recursive exhaustification and have access to the inclusive reading (parse) prior to the conjunctive one.

  description: >
      I propose a formal framework for belief revision using team semantics wich postulates that in belief ascriptions we systematicall neglect beliefs that are supported by an empty withess-set of possible worlds in our information state. I show that this framework can account for most inferences that hyperintensional frameworks are designed to explain and some additional inferences like possibility implicatuons of disjunctive beliefs, which topic- or aboutness-based may have troubles accounting for.
