    **Abstract:** This paper's main focus lies on the compositional semantics of clause-embedding predicates, i.e. verbs or verb-like expressions that represent a relationship between a subject
    and a proposition. It provides an improved characterisation of the selectional behaviour
    of the classes of responsive and anti-rogative predicates in terms of their semantic properties. I propose refinements of the hypotheses by Uegaki and Sudo (2019) and Roelofsen
    and Uegaki(2021), that are falsified by empirical data. My new proposals are that
    all     non-veridical and positively preferential predicates are anti-rogative
    and that all responsive predicates are either Q-to-P or P-to-Q distributive. The latter hypothesis can be
    alternatively formulated as: â€œsentences with corresponding interrogative and declarative
    complements embedded under the same predicate are always related by entailment.

    **Abstract:** Polar questions like "May I go to the park or to the beach?" seem to give rise to Free Choice-like inferences. The "yes" answer to such question seem to correspond to the permission to freely choose between going to the park and going to the beach. Similarly, the answer "No" seem to correspond to Dual Prohibition, i.e., prohibition to go to either place. 

    We conducted an experiment to empirically test whether these intuitions are true. In the talk I will indicate how the collected data can allow to establish the source of these inferences. Moreover, I will compare the results to the predictions of the current theories of Free Choice extended with question semantics.

     **Abstract**: Polar questions like 'May I go to the park or to the beach?' give rise to inferences similar to Free Choice Permission. The *Yes* answer to these questions corresponds to the permission to freely choose between going to the park and going to the beach. *No* corresponds to Dual Prohibition, i.e., prohibition to go to either place. I empirically tested these intuitions. I will indicate how the collected data can allow us to establish the source of these inferences and compare the findings to predictions made by current theories of Free Choice extended with question semantics. The collected data poses a challenge to the semantic and scalar approaches to *free choice* and supports non-scalar pragmatics as a uniform solution to the *free choice* puzzle.
