    **Investigating the properties of clause-embedding predicates in Polish** \
    This paper's main focus lies on the compositional semantics of clause-embedding predicates, i.e. verbs or verb-like expressions that represent a relationship between a subject
    and a proposition. It provides an improved characterisation of the selectional behaviour
    of the classes of responsive and anti-rogative predicates in terms of their semantic properties. I propose refinements of the hypotheses by Uegaki and Sudo (2019) and Roelofsen
    and Uegaki(2021), that are falsified by empirical data. My new proposals are that
    all     non-veridical and positively preferential predicates are anti-rogative
    and that all responsive predicates are either Q-to-P or P-to-Q distributive. The latter hypothesis can be
    alternatively formulated as: â€œsentences with corresponding interrogative and declarative
    complements embedded under the same predicate are always related by entailment.
